## ERN: Express-React-Node

**Note**. All the "data" in this repo is synthetic. It was generated by a random number generator.

## Introduction

This is an Express application that serves a React app in the `public` folder. The React app hits a few API endpoints in the `backend` folder.

The backend has access to a CSV file (of data that was generated with a random number generator).

The user of the frontend can select columns from the CSV file.

The app will be deployed on railway.
